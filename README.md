# Thread Inheritable Attributes

Passes thread variables to child spawned threads. Main use case is enabling logging in child thread to keep context of a request.
State only flows in one direction into the child threads and not back.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "thread-inheritable_attributes"
```

[request_store](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store) is a dependency for when working within the context of a multi-threaded web server. 
In that context Threads can be reused for different request causing state from a previous request to stick around to the next request. 
Unless your are manually reinitializing or clearing the state in your own Rack Middleware (at the start of a request) it is recommended that you also include the request_store gem.

If using Rails no config is required, except including the gem. When using other Rack based frameworks see [docs](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store#no-rails-no-problem) for including middleware.

```ruby
gem "request_store"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thread-inheritable_attributes

## Usage

```ruby
require "thread/inheritable_attributes"

Thread.current.set_inheritable_attribute(:request_id, SecureRandom.uuid)

thread = Thread.new {
          Thread.current.get_inheritable_attribute(:request_id)
        }
thread.join
thread.value
  #=> "80f58e0f-0564-487d-8f92-4cff8237af24"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
