# Thread Inheritable Attributes

Passes thread variables to child spawned threads. Main use case is enabling logging in child thread to keep context of a request.
State only flows in one direction into the child threads and not back.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "thread-inheritable_attributes"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thread-inheritable_attributes

## Usage

```ruby
require "thread/inheritable_attributes"

Thread.current.set_inheritable_attribute(:request_id, SecureRandom.uuid)

thread = Thread.new {
          Thread.current.get_inheritable_attribute(:request_id)
        }
thread.join
thread.value
  #=> "80f58e0f-0564-487d-8f92-4cff8237af24"
```
