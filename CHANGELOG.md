## v2.0.0 - 2016-09-09
### Enhancement
* RequestStore is now a required dependency

### Fix
* State only flows in one direction into the child threads and not back.

## v1.1.0 - 2016-06-14

### Fix
Addresses the use of `Thread.current` and the potential issues when used in the context of multi-threaded web server and replaces it with `RequestStore` when the gem can be loaded.

[request_store](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store) is an optional dependency for when working within the context of a multi-threaded web server. 
In that context Threads can be reused for different request causing state from a previous request to stick around to the next request. 
Unless your are manually reinitializing or clearing the state in your own Rack Middleware (at the start of a request) it is recommended that you also include the request_store gem.
